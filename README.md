# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project was to make an analysis of Amazon reviews. Furthermore, it was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. The main reason for this new task is to check if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from the paid Vine members in the available data.
